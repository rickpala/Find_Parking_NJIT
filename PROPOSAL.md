Proposal goals:
- What is the problem? Why is it interesting?
NJIT's parking decks sometimes reach capacity leaving commuters unable
to find a parking spot in time for their classes. This can be frustrating,
and NJIT has implemented measures to see the parking levels in each 
deck at http://mobile.njit.edu/parking. However, these stats are
only available in real-time. We seek to collect parking data over the
course of several weeks to be able to determine, before your commute,
whether or not you will find a parking spot at NJIT.

- Reading?
- Data collection?
- Algorithm or model? Improvements upon existing ones?
- How will we interpret results? Qualitative vs Quantitative
